                children.
                However, if we learn that we have received information
                from a child under the age of 18 without parental
                consent, we
                will delete that information from our database.</p>

            <h2><strong>About cookies</strong></h2>
            <p>A cookie is a file containing an
                identifier (a string of letters and
                numbers) that a web server transmits
                to a web
                browser and is stored by the
                browser. The identifier is then sent
                back to the server each time the
                browser requests
                a page from the server.</p>
            <p>Cookies may be either
                &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies or
                &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookies. A
                persistent
                cookie will be
                stored by a web browser and remain
                valid until its expiration date,
                unless it is deleted by the user,
                while a
                session cookie will expire when the
                web browser is closed at the end of
                the user session.</p>
            <p>Cookies do not typically contain any
                information that personally
                identifies a user, but personal data
                that we store
                about you may be linked to the
                information stored in and obtained
                from cookies. Cookies enable a
                website
                to remember
                your actions and preferences over a
